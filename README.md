# Using This Repo

1. Before you start working, pull the latest code from the `main` branch and create your own branch.

```
cd gw-rml-group4
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

2. Commit your edits and create a pull request.

```
git status
git add .  # this adds everything.  add individual files instead, if needed
git commit -m "tuned XGB parameters"
git push origin new-branch-name
```

...your terminal will give you a link to create the pull request on GitHub.  Make sure the target branch is `main`.

3. Ask Chip to review & merge.

Merge conflicts are likely since we're working on the same file simultaneously, and since that file is a combination of code and output.  Chip will sort it out!
